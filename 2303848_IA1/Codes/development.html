        <a name="sum"><h2 align="left" style="color: #8600e6;">Summary and Reflection</h2></a>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;The “Twelve Pillars” by Jim Rohn and Chris Widner is a motivational book that guides its readers towards self-improvement by blending storytelling
             and advice. The story does so by following <br>12 “pillars” that represent essential principles involved in personal growth and achievement. The story revolves
              around Michael Jones who encounters a much older man, and caretaker of the Twelve <br>Pillars estate, by the name of Charlie who through their many 
              conversations relates to Michael, various life lessons. We will be delving into a select number of these life lessons that were imparted.</p>
        
        <a name="four"><h3 align="left" style="color: goldenrod">Chapter Four</h3></a>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;In Chapter 4 of the book, Charlie communicates the importance of setting goals. This includes the various types that exist.
            <dl>
                <dt>Long Term</dt>
                <dd>Accomplishments to be made in the future 5+ years away</dd>

                <dt>Mid-Range Term</dt>
                <dd>Accomplishments to by the half point of the long-term goal</dd>

                <dt>Short Term</dt>
                <dd>Accomplishments to be made 2- 3 years away</dd>

                <dt>Micro Goals</dt>
                <dd>Each goal is only months away</dd>
            </dl>
            All of which are in the effort to reach the final goal. One important point that was brought up was that goals set aren't only important because it is what 
            a person wants to accomplish but rather goals <br>play a part in personal development because of what a person would need to do and/ or endure to make sure they
            make their goal a reality. The concept of micro goals is a new concept to me that I <br>can now utilize to make myself better and more equipped to tackle my 
            long-term goals for my career. Also, with the motivational viewpoint that allows me to consider challenges faced in achieving <br>my goal as tools in my 
            personal development, I will be more encouraged to tackle all obstacles.

        <a name="five"><h3 align="left" style="color: goldenrod">Chapter Five</h3></a>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;In Chapter 5 of the book, Charlie communicates the importance of time management when Charlie starts to complain about not having time to set and
            achieve his goals. He highlights the fact <br>that time is precious and how it is used greatly affects the degree of success a person gets in their endeavours.
            As a procrastinator I stand to gain a lot out of this chapter, it forces me to evaluate the <br>way I make use of time while doing assignments. A point made that
            I will have to keep in mind going forward is that it is not always wise to attend to the most urgent matter but rather the most <br>important.</p>

        <a name="six"><h3 align="left" style="color: goldenrod">Chapter Six</h3></a>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;In Chapter 6 of the book, Charlie communicates the importance of the social circle around you. This is because your social circle greatly 
            influences how you are. If an individual has persons <br>around them that aren't very ambitious they will feel comfortable not accomplishing anything in that 
            group because they would fit in. However, if the persons they surround themselves with are <br>committed to personal growth and success to keep up with the group
             the individual will be prompted to also improve to also succeed. Charlie highlights the point that surrounding yourself with the <br>right people also proves to
              build a network of accomplished personnel. The main part of this chapter that is of great help to me is his “rubric” to evaluate my group, the questions I 
              need to ask myself <br>about my social circle to determine if they are right for my personal growth.</p>

        <a name="seven"><h3 align="left" style="color: goldenrod">Chapter Seven</h3></a>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;In Chapter 7 of the book, Charlie illustrates the importance of being always willing to learn throughout life. Things, people and times change so 
            there is always knowledge to be gained in the <br>world. Charlie stressed the importance of books in gaining knowledge. This message especially applies to my 
            career choice it is an always adapting sector that prompts its participants to always be <br>gaining knowledge and learning new things so this ideology of always 
            learning through life is something I will need to adopt in my life after university. However, until then, I will be committed to reading <br>more non-fiction books.</p>

        <p>&emsp;&emsp;To conclude I am compelled to leave you with a profound quote from the book “A successful person is always a life-long learner.” If you wish to 
            read “Twelve Pillars” for yourself click <a href="../Assets/Twelve Pillars.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br>

        <a name="trait"><h3 align="left" style="color: goldenrod">Trait</h3></a>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;My most dominant personality trait is my nonchalant/laid-back nature. This trait allows me to handle academic pressure incredibly well, <br> I don't get stressed 
            about deadlines or get overwhelmed by difficult assignments, and this maintains a composed demeanour in situations <br> where others may struggle and get stressed. 
            Even so, being laid back has its disadvantages. At times, because I underestimate how much time <br>I need to complete tasks, I procrastinate and do assignments 
            at the last minute. Recently, I have had to balance working consistently and <br> staying relaxed.

        <a name="emote"><h3 align="left" style="color: goldenrod">Emotion</h3></a>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Even though I am laid back my strongest emotion is still my anxiety, and it plays a significant role in my academic life, especially during <br>
             assignments. I often times second-guess the work that I produce, worrying about whether I meet the expectations of my teachers. While this <br> enables me 
             to sometimes pay very close attention to details it also causes me to overthink tasks that should be simple and/or delay the starting <br>of a project 
             because I fear it won't be done properly.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <a name="hob"><h3 align="left" style="color: goldenrod">Hobby</h3></a>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;The watching of TV shows and sometimes movies has always been my premier choice for relaxation and leisure in and outside of my <br>academic life.
             Especially during exam periods, allowing myself to get captivated by these fictional worlds, plots and characters proves very <br>effective in giving my mind 
             a break from studying. It is also important to note that when the plot is compelling, with several plot twists, for <br>example in murder mysteries, it does 
             wonders in improving my analytical skills and critical thinking which are essential to developing software <br>solutions. However, as I am prone to 
             procrastination, indulging in this pastime can become hazardous as binging shows are a welcome distraction <br>during these periods.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

        <center><img src="../Assets/garvey.webp" alt="Image Not Found" style="border: 5px solid goldenrod;"></center>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;My hero is Marcus Mosiah Garvey, he was Jamaica's first  National Hero. He was born in Kingston, Jamaica, however throughout his career he travelled
            extensively, primarily the US and <br> the UK. This gave him exposure to the poor working and living conditions of black people around the world. This led to him becoming an activist for black
            people worldwide. In 1914, he started <br>the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), in Jamaica but it eventually grew internationally encouraging black 
            self-governance for black people worldwide, self-help economic projects <br>and protest against racial discrimination. It is for this reason why I chose him to be
            my hero, I consider my racial identity to be a very important part of my life and Marcus Garvey beliefs and <br> ideologies bears alot of direct and indirect responsibility for the upliftment
            of black people today, because of his inciting of black pride. From the labour riots of the 1930s in the Caribbean to the <br> American Civil Rights Movement
            many positive changes for black people were brought forth because Marcus Garvey chose to stand for what he believed in, which is a good trait for any individual <br> to have.
            The quote I chose not only speaks to him standing up for black people but he is also explains to his people that it is important to know our history.

        <a name="valid"><h3 align="left" style="color: goldenrod">Validity Reflection</h3></a>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;I chose to do the Keirsey personality test however I would say that the test is invalid because it uses a binary response system. There is no 
            opportunity to give more nuanced resonses to the <br> questions that were given. The results that I recieved, as seen <a href="#shot">above</a>, hightligts this
            invalidity through points made about my personality that aren't true. The test concluded that I am a Artisan.<br> It stated that artisans are optimistic, 
            focused, trusting of their impulses and naturally gifted in the arts. This evaluation is wrong on all counts:
            <ul type="square/circle">
                <li>Optimistic:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I am a very pessimistic person, I tend to always expect the worst outcome out of a situation</li><br>
                </ul>

                <li>Focused:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generally, to remain <q>engaged</q> in an activity I need to be doing something else i.e listening to music, watching something etc.</li><br>
                </ul>

                <li>Trusting of Impulses:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I constantly second guess myself.</li><br>
                </ul>

                <li>Naturally gifted in the Arts:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I am not an artistic person, I find it very difficult to be creative</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            &emsp;&emsp;In essence, I consider the test to be very invalid however would give more 
            accurate and valid results if it gave a range of options similar to the Briggs Myers test.</p><br>
